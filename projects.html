                    <p>Create a music recommendation machine learning model with my own data scraping.</p>
                    <h3>Details</h3>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to try a different approach to recommending songs to see 
                        how well it would work and to possibly introduce new songs to people.
                        To accomplish this, I decided I would request song information from the
                        Spotify API. I would then use the Wikipedia API to find the corresponding
                        articles for the songs if one existed. My machine learning model was then
                        trained by using comparisons of the Wikipedia articles to get similarity
                        ratings for different songs.

                        Through this project, I was able to reinforce my knowledge of SQL,
                        connecting to and using unfamiliar APIs in my projects, and gathering
                        needed data to reach a goal. I was also able to learn more about Python
                        machine learning and pipelines.

                    <p>
                        I thought it would be a good learning opportunity to try to create a
                        secure user login system by myself. While I would not use this for real
                        site users, it helped me think through the process of making and securing
                        a database of users. I implemented features such as two-factor authentication,
                        email validation, session tokens, password resetting, security questions, login
                        tracking, and IP tracking.

                        I learned how to implement user authentication and authorization, how to keep
                        important data secure through hashing and preventing things such as SQL injections,
                        token generation and tracking, and input validation.

                        It was a priority for me to make my portfolio website functional on
                        all devices, so this website is responsive to whatever device it is
                        viewed on. All the extra features are implemented using Javascript.

                        I learned a lot about making a website responsive through CSS and javascript.
                        I was also able to tinker around with javascript to make some extra user
                        interactivity.

                        I wanted to strengthen my javascript knowledge by spending a little bit of time
                        on a project and I enjoy math, so I thought it would be cool to make my own Simple
                        graphing calculator that I could expand on later. Other than obviously the HTML, I
                        only used javascript so that I could become more familiar with it. I implemented
                        features such as having multiple functions, being able to toggle function visibility,
                        being able to adjust graph details, and being able to pan and zoom on the graph.

                        I learned a lot about javascript and making projects in it while developing this.
                        I also learned about correctly handling user interaction and got to practice making
                        some simple regular expressions.

                    <p>
                        I thought it would be useful to have a HTML viewer so I could test small ideas/pages
                        before trying to implement them in the actual code, so I made one with javascript.
                        It is very simple, just executing the input code and showing it in a frame.

                        I wanted to practice web design and javascript by making a clean, simple game.
                        In the game, the user is provided a word that has had a Caeser cipher applied to it
                        (so each letter is shifted away from its original position). From there, the user simply
                        inputs a shift amounts to shift the letters until they get the original word.

                        using CSS to get that simple, clean look. I was also able to practice using javascript
                        to manipulate elements and get user input.

                        on making a Rubik's cube program. I programmed in all the possible moves, and the program
                        is able to shuffle and solve a Rubik's cube.
