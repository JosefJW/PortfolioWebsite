                    <p>
                        This project involves implementing a custom text-to-speech (TTS) model using deep 
                        learning techniques. The model is trained to generate speech from text by processing 
                        spectrograms through a neural network architecture consisting of Convolutional and 
                        Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. The project includes building the model, preprocessing 
                        data (creating spectrograms from audio files and getting text), and generating speech through 
                        a spectrogram-to-audio conversion process using Griffin-Lim. This solution demonstrates 
                        proficiency in deep learning, audio signal processing, and the creation of machine learning 
                        models for speech synthesis.

                        Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in deep learning for text-to-speech synthesis. 
                        I learned how to preprocess and convert audio data into spectrograms, build and train neural 
                        networks using TensorFlow, and apply techniques like LSTMs for sequence prediction. Additionally, 
                        I explored audio signal processing methods such as Griffin-Lim to convert spectrograms back into speech.

                        I wanted to try a different approach to recommending songs to see 
                        how well it would work and to possibly introduce new songs to people.
                        To accomplish this, I decided I would request song information from the
                        Spotify API. I would then use the Wikipedia API to find the corresponding
                        articles for the songs if one existed. My machine learning model was then
                        trained by using comparisons of the Wikipedia articles to get similarity
                        ratings for different songs.

                        needed data to reach a goal. I was also able to learn more about Python

                        site users, it helped me think through the process of making and securing
                        a database of users. I implemented features such as two-factor authentication,
                        email validation, session tokens, password resetting, security questions, login
                        tracking, and IP tracking.

                        token generation and tracking, and input validation.

                    <p>
                        Dual numbers are similar to complex numbers. They have a real part and a dual part.
                        The cool thing about dual numbers is, if you plug them into a function, the real part
                        equals the normal value of the function and the dual part equals the value of the
                        derivative of the function.
                        Eventually, I want to make my own neural network program from scratch. Since you
                        need to take lots of derivatives in order to do that, I thought it would be useful
                        to have these numbers to more easily do that, so I implemented basic arithmetic and a
                        plethora of common math functions to work with them.

                        only used javascript so that I could become more familiar with it. I implemented
                        features such as having multiple functions, being able to toggle function visibility,

                        inputs a shift amounts to shift the letters until they get the original word.

                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>Practice coding with C.</p>
                    <h3>Details</h3>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to practice coding with C and doing light memory manipulation, so I decided
                        on making a Rubik's cube program. I programmed in all the possible moves, and the program
                        is able to shuffle and solve a Rubik's cube.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Project</h3>
                    <p>There currently is no end-user product, just the code that is viewable in the <a href="https://github.com/JosefJW/rubiksCube" target="_blank">Github Reposity</a>.</p>
                    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project was more for getting extra practice doing things I already knew how to do with C.
